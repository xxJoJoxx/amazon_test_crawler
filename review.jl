This is where the problems started.  I have a 58 Mbps Internet connection and downloads are usually very, very fast.  I took 2-3 hours to download the first file, which was a conglomeration of many fixes.  The Installation went relatively fast.  The next download was Service Pack 1 and that took 3-4 hours.  I checked my Network speed at speedtest.net several times and it indicated from 1 Mbps to 10 Mbps and wouldn't even start a few times.  I had my old computer on the table next to it, so I moved the Ethernet cable from the Dell to the old computer and ran Speedtest several times, always indicating 58-59 Mbps.  This pretty much told me that the Network card on the Dell was Bad.  I filed a return with Amazon and it was approved by the seller, who was  Candance Ross, thru Amazon - BUT, I was to pay the return shipping fee, which was $65.00.  I thought that was not right, since I bought a new computer, but was sold a DEFECTIVE one.  I have learned my lesson to not buy through one of the Amazon partners, because I am sure that Amazon would have paid for the shipping costs to return it."}, {"customer_comments_title": "Rainbows and missing drivers.", "customer_comments_author": "Sierra", "customer_comments_date": " November 6, 2015", "customer_comments_rating": "1.0 ", "customer_comments_text": "I don't know if this unit was refurbished or what but the way it was shipped, it's contents packaged and the simple instruction, etc., it makes you question if it was. First, hooked it up, plugged it in, and the desktop couldn't detect the WIFI during setup. After several hours with Dell tech support, it was determined that several drivers were missing, including the WIFI driver and front USB drivers. Did an ethernet connection, a remote assist and still couldn't update the drivers, even in safe mode. After 3 hours, the screen went blank and started to illustrate all the different colors in the rainbow with intermittent static shots. What a joke. Dell wanted to send a tech out to fix, within the next 3 business days. BIOS reported that no WIFI card was installed after trying to update drivers so tech determined it's also a hardware issue. I asked why wasn't this tested before being shipped out and they responded that since it was Amazon's product for sale, they are suppose to test it.  I am shipping it back today. What a joke and waste of my time! Black Friday is around the corner, I'll find a better deal and comp. I only bought this machine because of all the rave reviews.

Finally got to support and was transferred to several \"specialists\" and none were able to help us so they said they would send out a Dell tech within the next 3 business days with a new motherboard as that one seems to be damaged in shipping.  So now have to wait to see if the tech shows up and is able to find the problem so we can continue to set it up.  Worked easy for the setup to that point but if you can't go further can't use the computer at all.. Very disappointed that got a new computer with Windows 10 and couldn't get it to work yet.  Suggest they put a Dell support number on the small set up pamphlet as there was no information at all as to who to contact should you have problems with the setup.  I hope I can give a better review after the tech comes out and can say all is well and computer is up and running."}]}
